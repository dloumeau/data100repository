## Below I plotted three spatial plots depicting the de facto location of human settlements and urban areas, the center lines of classified roadways and the location of health care facilities by type throughout the combined boundary of Ponhea Lueu and Mukh Kampul

The population count over Ponhea Lueu and Mukh Kampul is roughly 231,000 (about 132,000 people in Pohnea Lueu and the other 99,000 in Mukh Kampul). There are about 23 communes or major urban areas, 9 of which are located in Mukh Kampul and the other 14 being in Ponhea Lueu. Urban areas are spread out relatively evenly in Ponhea Lueu. In Mukh Kampul, the primary urban areas are found in the south with 2 or 3 smaller regions up north. The middle region (west ponhea Lueu and east Mukh Kampal) is veryy barren and has no major populated region in its vicinity. In Ponhea Lueu, there are 2 major urban areas on opposite sides of the province and 12 smaller regions dispersed. When viewing the combined adm 2's as a whole, there are three very populated areas in the middle gorund for density. The other 20 urban areas are smaller. While these areas are less populated, some of them are very dense and others range in density. Overall there are three primary roads and 11 secondary roads. The primary road runs through the heart of Ponhea Lueu bypassing the two major urban areas and many of the smaller dispersed ones. A secondary road also runs through Ponhea Lueu but on the Mukh Kampul side. The other secondary roads primarily run along the borders of the combined adm2. And with the smaller urban areas being located closer to the borders, the road layout will hit all the major urban areas. Overall, there are 8 hospitals and 1 pharmacy. The pharmacy is on the northwest side of Ponhea Lueu and this location doesn't provide much access for a lot of the population. The hospitals are relatively dispersed. 5 hospitals can be accessed along the primary road and the other 3 via the secondary roads. There are also hospitals located by the three most major urban areas. However, there are two regions in the north of Mukh Kampul that are somewhat far from the nearest hospital.
