# Data Science Reflection #4 Scale by Geoff West

## Provide three examples from Geoff West’s reading that illustrate how scale can be used to more fully understand human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system.  Additionally, what did Geoff West have to say about the use of theory and big data?  According to West, can a theory be relevant in  the face of big data?  Please provide an example.

   In his book “Scale: The Universal Laws of Life and Death in Organisms, Cities and Companies”, Geoff West describes the nature of complex systems and explains how 
utilizing scale will lead to a more fuller understanding of human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system. Scaling is how a system responds 
when it’s size changes. In terms of systems, quantitative scaling describes how any measurable characteristic of plants, animals, ecosystems, companies, and 
cities can scale with size.
