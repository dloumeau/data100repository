# Hello! Welcome to my Wicked Problems repository

My name is Daniel Loumeau and I am a freshman from Long Island, New York. I have been taking classes on the pre-med track but am still undecided about my major. Outside academics, I love playing soccer, watching movies, and spending time with friends.
